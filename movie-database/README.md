Built a Movie database for movie rating and reviews.

With the use of OMDBAPI http://www.omdbapi.com/, This movie database was built to help movie loves know the rating and summaries of movies before they watch them.

For developing this project developer language such as React + Vite, HTML, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript was used to develop the web app.

The Landing page comprices of the components like the Home.jsx and the searchbar.jsx to help view know which movie to go for.

Components:
Home.jsx showcase movies rated 6+ by OMDb and refresh each time a user check in and out.
Whereas Searchbar.jsx allows user to search for their own titles to know about their rate and summary of a movie.
MovieDetials.jsx showcase a card which holds all the details of a selected movie.

This webapp is meant to help user know more about their movie choices before they watch them.
